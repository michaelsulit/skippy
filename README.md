skippy
======

A programming language for the free at heart.

Syntax
======

Skippy does not use if statements, loops, or any other normal control statements.
Instead, it uses the following:

BEGIN
END
SKIP

BEGIN can only be placed at the start of a program.
END can be placed anywhere, and there can be multiple ENDs.

SKIP takes a number and sets the skip value.
if the value is negative, then it will skip backwards.
